## Hi, I'm Maciek :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

I'm learning Java since the end of past year... and enjoying the process!

I hope I can truthfully say that I'm acquainted with core Java at some decent (but quite basic) level.
To check that you can take a look at my public repositories:

:point_right: [LiBook](https://github.com/y-k-e-s/LiBook) was writen after 3 month of learning, so dont be too harsh.

:point_right: [MVCbookstore](https://github.com/y-k-e-s/MVCbookstore) is a little bit more advanced (due to use of Spring, Hibernate etc).

Right now I'm focusing on functional programing in Java.  

Curently reading *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch.
